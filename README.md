# Introducing APIs

There are a few core concepts you need to understand in making API requests. By the end of this morning's workshop you should be able to answer the following questions:
- What is the request-response pattern and how does this relate to API requests?
- What is http?
- What is an xhr?
- What does 'asynchronous' mean?


### Preparation
- If you're at all hazy about how the internet works, watch [this excellent explanation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc)
- If you're interested in how domains are translated into ip addresses, watch [this amusing discussion of DNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72snZctFFtA)
- REST (Representational State Transfer) is a best practice standard for web interactions. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCcAE2SCQ6k) gives a clear explanation of REST.


### Postman
Postman is an HTTP client for testing web services (eg APIs). It allows you send a ton of requests to APIs without having to write out the code each time. It's a handy tool to know about.  

**Install postman:** you should have the Postman chrome plugin installed. If not, talk to a course mentor or
follow [this link](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/introduction)

**Open postman:** type 'chrome://apps/' into your chrome address bar

**Use postman:** read about postman in the documentation [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/requests).

## What the hell is Postman?

Postman is an HTTP client for testing web services (eg APIs). Postman lets you send requests to APIs without having to write the code each time. This can be useful if you have several APIs and you want to check what sort of response you might get back.  

**Install postman:** you should have the Postman chrome plugin installed. If not, talk to a course mentor or
follow [this link](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/introduction)

**Open postman:** type 'chrome://apps/' into your chrome address bar

**Use postman:** read about postman in the documentation [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/requests).
